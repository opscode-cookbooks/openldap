openldap Cookbook
=================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/openldap.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/openldap)
[![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/openldap.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/openldap)

Configures a server to be an OpenLDAP master, OpenLDAP replication slave, or OpenLDAP client.


Requirements
------------
#### Platforms
- Ubuntu 10.04+
- Debian
- FreeBSD 10
- RHEL and derivitives

#### Chef
- Chef 11+

#### Cookbooks
- openssl (for slave recipe)
- freebsd

Note:  The openldap::auth recipe will restart sshd and nscd if the openssh or nscd recipes are included in the runlist

Attributes
----------
Be aware of the attributes used by this cookbook and adjust the defaults for your environment where required, in `attributes/default.rb`.

### Overall install attributes
- `openldap['package_install_action']` - The action to be taken for all packages in the recipes. Defaults to :install, but can also be set to :upgrade to upgrade all packages referenced in the recipes.

### Client node attributes

- `openldap['server_uri']` - the URI of the LDAP server
- `openldap['basedn']` - basedn
- `openldap['cn']` - admin
- `openldap['server']` - the LDAP server fully qualified domain name, default `'ldap'.node['domain']`.
- `openldap['tls_enabled']` - specifies whether TLS will be used at all. Setting this to fals will result in your credentials being sent in clear-text.
- `openldap['tls_checkpeer']` - specifies whether the client should verify the server's TLS certificate. Highly recommended to set tls_checkpeer to true for production uses in order to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks. Defaults to false for testing and backwards compatibility.
- `openldap['pam_password']` - specifies the password change protocol to use. Defaults to md5.

### Server node attributes

- `openldap['schemas']` - Array of ldap schema file names to load
- `openldap['modules']` - Array of slapd modules names to load
- `openldap['ppolicy']` - Set this to true to enable the password policy overlay. Defaults to false
- `openldap['ppolicy_hash_cleartext']` - If the password policy overlay is enabled, set ppolicy_hash_cleartext. Defaults to true
- `openldap['ppolicy_use_lockout']` - If the password policy overlay is enabled, set ppolicy_use_lockout. Defaults to true
- `openldap['auditlog']` - Set this to true to enable the audit log overlay. Defaults to false
- `openldap['auditlog_file']` - If the audit log overlay is enabled, this configures the file to write to. Defaults to /var/log/openldap/audit.log (note - the directory this is in must be writable by the ldap user)
- `openldap['slapd_type']` - master | slave
- `openldap['slapd_rid']` - unique integer ID, required if type is slave.
- `openldap['slapd_master']` - hostname of slapd master, attempts to search for slapd_type master.
- `openldap['syncrepl_filter']` - The search filter to use in the replication
- `openldap['syncrepl_interval']` - The interval for the sync.  Defaults to 1 day
- `openldap['database']` - Preferred database backend, defaults to HDB or MDB (for FreeBSD).
- `openldap['manage_ssl']` - Whether or not this cookbook manages your SSL certificates.
   If set to `true`, this cookbook will expect your SSL certificates to be in files/default/ssl and will configure slapd appropriately.
   If set to `false`, you will need to provide your SSL certificates **prior** to this recipe being run. Be sure to set `openldap['ssl_cert']` and `openldap['ssl_key']` appropriately.
- `openldap['ssl_cert']` - The full path to your SSL certificate.
- `openldap['ssl_key']` - The full path to your SSL key.
- `openldap['ssl_cert_source_cookbook']` - The cookbook to find the ssl cert.  Defaults to this cookbook
- `openldap['ssl_cert_source_path']` - The path in the cookbook to find the ssl cert file.
- `openldap['ssl_key_source_cookbook']` - The cookbook to find the ssl key.  Defaults to this cookbook
- `openldap['ssl_key_source_path']` - The path in the cookbook to find the ssl key file.
- `openldap['cafile']` - Your certificate authority's certificate (or intermediate authorities), if needed.

Recipes
-------
### auth

Sets up the system for using openldap for user authentication.

### default

Empty placeholder recipe.

### client

Install the openldap client packages.

### server

Set up openldap to be a slapd server. Use this if your environment would only have a single slapd server.

### master

Sets the `node['openldap']['slapd_type']` to master and then includes the `openldap::server` recipe.

### slave

Sets the `node['openldap']['slapd_type']` to slave, then includes the `openldap::server` recipe. If the node is running chef-solo, then the `node['openldap']['slapd_replpw']` and `node['openldap']['slapd_master']` attributes must be set in the JSON attributes file passed to `chef-solo`.


Usage
-----
Edit Rakefile variables for SSL certificate.

On client systems,

```ruby
include_recipe "openldap::auth"
```

This will install the required packages and configuration for client systems. This is required on openldap server installs as well, so this is a good candidate for inclusion in a base role or cookbook.

On server systems, if there's only on LDAP server, then use the `openldap::server` recipe. If replication is required, use the `openldap::master` and `openldap::slave` recipes instead.


### A note about certificates

Certificates created by the Rakefile are self signed. If you have a purchased CA, that can be used.

We provide two methods of managing SSL certificates, based off of `openldap['manage_ssl']`.

If `openldap['manage_ssl']` is `true`, then this cookbook manage your certificates itself, and will expect all certificates, intermediate certificates, and keys to be in the same file as defined in `openldap['ssl_cert']`.  To prevent forking this cookbook you can provide the cookbook that contains the cert files using the `openldap['ssl_cert_source_cookbook'] ` and `openldap['ssl_key_source_cookbook']` attributes.  By default they expect the files to exist within this cookbook.

If `openldap['manage_ssl']` is `false`, then you will need to place the SSL certificates on the client file system **prior** to this cookbook being run. This provides you the flexibility to provide the same set of SSL certificates for multiple uses as well as in one place across your environment, but you will need to manage them.
- Set `openldap['ssl_cert']`, `openldap['ssl_key']`, and `openldap['cafile']` appropriately.
- Ensure that that user openldap can access these files. Watch out for apparmor and SELinux if you are placing your SSL certificates in a non-default location.

### New Directory
If installing for the first time, the initial directory needs to be created. Create an ldif file, and start populating the directory.

### Passwords
Set the password, openldap['rootpw'] for the rootdn in the node's attributes. This should be a password hash generated from slappasswd. The default slappasswd command on Ubuntu 8.10 and Mac OS X 10.5 will generate a SHA1 hash:

    $ slappasswd -s "secretsauce"
    {SSHA}6BjlvtSbVCL88li8IorkqMSofkLio58/

Set this by default in the attributes file, or on the node's entry in the webui.
